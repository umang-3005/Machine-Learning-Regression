Project Overview:
This project addresses a two-part tabular regression challenge with distinct objectives and deployment constraints:

Part 1: Build a high-performance ML model to predict the continuous target target01 from 273 features

Part 2: Reverse-engineer a rule-based system for target02 that must run on edge devices without ML inference capabilities

Dataset Specifications:

Training samples: 10,000

Features: 273 (feat_1 through feat_273)

Two regression targets: target01 and target02

Part 1: Predicting target01
Approach
A robust regression pipeline combining feature selection with gradient boosting:
Data Preprocessing: Median imputation for missing values
Feature Selection: ExtraTreesRegressor-based selection (273 → 136 features)
Model: HistGradientBoostingRegressor with optimized hyperparameters
Validation: 5-fold cross-validation with out-of-fold predictions

Pipeline Architecture
python
Pipeline([
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='median')),
    ('selector', SelectFromModel(
        estimator=ExtraTreesRegressor(n_estimators=400),
        threshold='median'
    )),
    ('reg', HistGradientBoostingRegressor(
        learning_rate=0.05,
        max_leaf_nodes=31,
        min_samples_leaf=10,
        max_iter=900,
        random_state=42
    ))
])
Performance Metrics

Part 2: Rule-Based Prediction for target02
Problem Statement
Predict target02 using only simple conditional rules and arithmetic operations (no ML at runtime) for edge device deployment.

Discovered Rule System
Key Feature: feat_132 (gating feature)
Predictor Features: feat_108, feat_116, feat_255
Thresholds: 0.2, 0.5, 0.7

Rule Formulas
python
if feat_132 ≤ 0.2:
    target02 = 1.35×feat_108 + 1.75×feat_116 - 0.75×feat_255

elif feat_132 ≤ 0.5:
    target02 = 0.35×feat_108 - 0.45×feat_116 + 0.55×feat_255

elif feat_132 ≤ 0.7:
    target02 = 0.15×feat_108 + 0.85×feat_116 - 1.95×feat_255

else:  # feat_132 > 0.7
    target02 = 1.85×feat_108 - 1.75×feat_116 - 0.75×feat_255
Validation Results
Region	Condition	Samples	R²	Max Error
1	≤ 0.2	1,999	1.0	~10⁻¹⁵
2	(0.2, 0.5]	2,951	1.0	~10⁻¹⁵
3	(0.5, 0.7]	2,011	1.0	~10⁻¹⁵
4	> 0.7	3,039	1.0	~10⁻¹⁵
Note: Errors at 10⁻¹⁵ scale indicate floating-point precision limits, confirming perfect reconstruction.

Methodology Highlights
Part 1: Machine Learning Pipeline
Feature Selection Rationale: Reduces overfitting by eliminating 50% of low-importance features using median-threshold ExtraTreesRegressor

Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV over 243 combinations (5-fold CV)

Validation Strategy: Out-of-fold predictions to prevent leakage

Domain Shift Analysis: ROC-based classifier to detect train/eval distribution differences

Part 2: Rule Discovery Process
Tree Exploration: DecisionTreeRegressor to identify splitting feature and thresholds

Threshold Simplification: Rounding to 0.1 precision for deployable boundaries

Per-Region Regression: LinearRegression fitted independently in each region

Validation: Numerical parity check (reconstruction error ~10⁻¹⁵)

Visualizations
The project generates comprehensive visualizations for analysis:

Part 1: Target distribution, domain shift ROC curve

Part 2: Decision tree structure, coefficient contributions, feature distributions, actual vs predicted comparisons
